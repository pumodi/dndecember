# DnDecember 2020 - Advent Calendar
## Quest Hooks

In the Flowering Wreath tavern, the smell of cinammon and cloves wafts around the patrons. Guests drink ciders, eggnogs, and festive ales while swapping 
tales of recent adventures. Everyone is looking forward to spending time with their families during the month of snowfall ahead. The owner of the tavern
is yet to rest and needs some work done. Every day a new task is placed on the job board, open for anyone and everyone to take. 

These quest hooks are to be used by any DM in any situation it makes sense! I'll be writing one new hook a day from now until Christmas and will vaguely
theme them around a snowy region.

### List

* Dec 1st - A group of kobolds have been terrorizing some local children. They seem to want to join snowball fights but don't quite understand the rules. 
Chiefly because they are using lumps of coal instead of snowballs. Which is odd, because coal is neither a snow nor ball. Local parents are asking
anyone for help.
* Dec 2nd - A group of snow sculptures have come to life in the nearby graveyard. They are moving incredibly slowly towards town....menacingly. The
cleric from the temple adjacent to the graveyard have mentioned someone, or something, hanging out by the grave stones at night, chanting quietly
while rolling snow body parts. The temple is asking someone to investigate and stop the snow sculpture shambling. Though there's no rush. As they said,
they move incredibly slowly.

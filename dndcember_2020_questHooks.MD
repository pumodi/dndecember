# DnDecember 2020 - Advent Calendar
## Quest Hooks

In the Flowering Wreath tavern, the smell of cinammon and cloves wafts around the patrons. Guests drink ciders, eggnogs, and festive ales while swapping 
tales of recent adventures. Everyone is looking forward to spending time with their families during the month of snowfall ahead. The owner of the tavern
is yet to rest and needs some work done. Every day a new task is placed on the job board, open for anyone and everyone to take. 

These quest hooks are to be used by any DM in any situation it makes sense! I'll be writing one new hook a day from now until Christmas and will vaguely
theme them around a snowy region.

### List

* Dec 1st - A group of kobolds have been terrorizing some local children. They seem to want to join snowball fights but don't quite understand the rules. 
Chiefly because they are using lumps of coal instead of snowballs. Which is odd, because coal is neither a snow nor ball. Local parents are asking
anyone for help.
* Dec 2nd - A group of snow sculptures have come to life in the nearby graveyard. They are moving incredibly slowly towards town....menacingly. The
cleric from the temple adjacent to the graveyard have mentioned someone, or something, hanging out by the grave stones at night, chanting quietly
while rolling snow body parts. The temple is asking someone to investigate and stop the snow sculpture shambling. Though there's no rush. As they said,
they move incredibly slowly.
* Dec 3rd - Some locals have been reporting stories of townsfolk going mad and lashing out at their neighbours. The way they attack don't seem to share
any similarities and recovery times vary wildly. The only constant is each person referenced kissing someone under a winter-berry sprig mounted above a door,
as per local tradition. There's a small reward for anyone who can figure out what's going on.
* Dec 4th - The town seems to be celebrating the season with a new tradition: bare knuckled brawling. The local merchant's guild is sponsoring a fight night with prizes for the top three competitors. Even better, a famous wizard is making a boxing-ring out of ice just for the occassion. So you can fight AND BE COLD! Entry is free with prizes sponsored by the guild.
* Dec 5th - Tavern Master Gwen is upset. Someone's been stealing all the eggnong and now she can't seem to find someone to supply anymore. All of her normal sources have been saying that it's 'not safe'.
* Dec 6th - There's an apple pie eating contest tonight! Come and challenge the local champion! Top score is 37 slices. If you can beat it you get a championship belt and free meals at the bakery for the rest of the month.
* Dec 7th - There's a halfling running around town in a red tunic, green pointy hat, and bright red shoes with bells on. He keeps yelling 'FIGHT ME!' at everyone who walks past. The town guard has declared him a nuissance but he keeps evading their grasp. Which is odd, because he makes a lot of noise with the bells on his shoes. Some guards folk have said it sometimes feels like the jingling is coming from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.
* Dec 8th - Adventurers have been bringing reports back of a dungeon filled with presents. Other adventurers have also been saying that those presents are eating people. Sounds like there is a festive mimic infestation nearby. There's a reward for anyone who can clear out the halls. The locals have been keen on 'decking' them.
* Dec 9th - There is a group of carrolers in town who are looking for extra performers to join them! Right now they've just been performing in town but they've been asked to do a show at the nearby Ice Castle. That's fun! 
* Dec 10th - Snowball fight! Near the edge of town a large group of people have started a long running snowball fight. They've built forts....and cannons.....and...is that a Wooden Horse?
* Dec 11th - The Blacksmith wants to make some wreaths out of old swords and other weapons that are too far damaged to be worth anything. They'll take donations but iis asking for help to source some material. They're offering some free repairs to adventurers who can assist in the giving season.
* Dec 12th - A nearby forest has seen all of their Fir trees start to rot at an alarming rate. Oddly, the other trees seem to be fine, even growing at an accelerated rate. The Rangers guild is asking for assistance in identifying the issue.
* Dec 13th - The schoolteacher has created enchanted lights that blink in the colors of the festive season. They are meant to be hung over thresholds, on trees, etc. For some reason her magic seems to not be working as well as it used to. Lights only stay lit for a little while, if at all. Anyone who might be able to help would be greatly welcomed.
* Dec 14th - A brawl broke out in the tavern last night. Someone was arguing that halflings were actually elves, not elves as we typically know them. According to this person Elves are small and make toys for an overweight delivery man. An elf overheard and got very upset. Their both in the guard house right now and town guard is try to calm them down. There's got to be a way to sort this out.
* Dec 15th - There's a cold front blowing in from the east. Something about it feels unnatural. The leader of the local druid conclavew has reached out. They think they might know what's causing it, or rather who is causing it. The conclave is seeking someone to assist as protection while a diplomatic group travels to try and settle the situation.
* Dec 16th - A young dwarf woman has come to town asking for help providing shelter for the town over. They suffered some rather unfortunate losses during a recent blizzard and could use extra hands getting some walls up.
